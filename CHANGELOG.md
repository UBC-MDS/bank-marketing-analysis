# Changes

- fit_bank_classifier.py: Bug addressed. No warning message on execution. 
    The size of the training data would not be reduced as that was not an error.

- README.md: Removed white unnecessary white spaces in command line instructions.
- feat_imp.py: resampled_training_data changed to transformed_training_data.
