## About

In this analysis, we attempt to build a predictive model aimed at determining whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit, utilizing the data associated with direct marketing campaigns, specifically phone calls, in a Portuguese banking institution.

After exploring on several models (logistic regression, KNN, decision tree, naive Bayers), we have selected the logistic regression model as our primary predictive tool. The final model performs fairly well when tested on an unseen dataset, achieving the highest AUC (Area Under the Curve) of 0.899. This exceptional AUC score underscores the model's capacity to effectively differentiate between positive and negative outcomes. Notably, certain factors such as last contact duration, last contact month of the year and the clients' types of jobs play a significant role in influencing the classification decision.

The dataset used in this project originates from the Bank Marketing dataset created by S. Moro, P. Rita and P. Cortez at Iscte - University Institute of Lisbon. This dataset is accessible through the UCI Machine Learning Repository and can be accessed [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing). Among the four available datasets, we have utilized [bank-full.csv](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/static/public/222/data.csv) which contains all examples and 17 inputs. Each row in the dataset represents an individual client data including the personal details (e.g., age, occupation, loan status, etc.), information regarding their response to the marketing campaign (e.g., outcomes of the previous marketing campaign, number of contacts made during the current campaign, etc.), and the eventual subscription outcome for the term deposit.

## Usage

#### Setup

1.  [Install](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) and launch Docker on your computer.

2.  Clone this GitHub repository.

#### Running the analysis

1.  Navigate to the root of this project on your computer using the command line and enter the following command:

```         
docker compose up
```

2.  In the terminal, look for a URL that starts with `http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=` (for an example, see the highlighted text in the terminal below). Copy and paste that URL into your browser.

3.  To run the analysis, open `notebooks/analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Lab you just launched and under the "Kernel" menu click "Restart Kernel and Run All Cells...".

#### Clean up

1.  To shut down the container and clean up the resources, type `Cntrl` + `C` in the terminal where you launched the container, and then type `docker compose rm`

## Developer notes

#### Adding a new dependency

1.  Add the dependency to the `Dockerfile` file on a new branch.

2.  Re-build the Docker image locally to ensure it builds and runs properly.

3.  Push the changes to GitHub. A new Docker image will be built and pushed to Docker Hub automatically. It will be tagged with the SHA for the commit that changed the file.

4.  Update the `docker-compose.yml` file on your branch to use the new container image (make sure to update the tag specifically).

5.  Send a pull request to merge the changes into the `main` branch.

#### Running the tests

Tests are run using the `pytest` command in the root of the project. More details about the test suite can be found in the [`tests`](tests) directory.
